/*
 * Your task is to implement a program (mfind) which locates a string
 * in a file using mmap(). Its command line syntax is as follows:
 *
 *  mfind <filename> <string>
 *
 * For example, if user executes '$ mfind /var/log/dmesg SELinux', 
 * 'SELinux' is searched from /var/log/dmesg file and if found, it prints out
 * "string SELinux found at offset 8671" or if not found, it prints out
 * "string SELinux not found in file"
 * 
 * You have to implement this program using mmap() - you need to search
 * the string using memory file map instead of read() system call.
 *
 * By using mmap(), you don't have to allocate memory buffer to store
 * the file content if you use read() - mmap() just creates region of 
 * virtual address from which you can directly access the content of the file.
 *
 * The actual string search part should be done using supplied strnstr()
 * function. (strnstr() is the same as the standard strstr() except that it
 * checks the length of the source. check man page of strstr for details)
 *
 * The mmap() call requires many parameters. Part of your task is to figure
 * out the correct set of parameters by studying man pages, internet search,
 * looking up POSIX mmap() man pages written by OPEN group, and experimentation.
 * 
 * mmap() needs you to specify the size of the memory map via second parameter.
 * You may set this value equal to the size of the file. fstat() is the call
 * you should use to query information of a file. Again, it is your task to 
 * figure out how to use fstat() library call.
 * 
 * In C, argv[] contains the command line arguments as null-terminated strings.
 * argc contains the number of arguments including the command itself. 
 * For example, if one executes 
 *
 *  $ ./mfind ./exactly_4k.txt SEL
 *
 * then 
 * argv[0] is a pointer to string "./mfind",
 * argv[1] is a pointer to string "./exactly_4k.txt", 
 * argv[2] is a pointer to string "SEL" and
 * argv[3] is NULL.
